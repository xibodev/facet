// Chargeability must have exactly ONE source, and this tests the PROPERTY
// behaviourally rather than by scanning source.
//
// Every other test here asserts that eight named tools are chargeable. All of
// them pass if someone re-introduces a second hardcoded list with identical
// values — the duplication a single source exists to prevent, and the state
// that existed before it was collapsed. Verified: that mutant passed the whole
// suite. Midden ran the same shape against their tree and found the same gap.
//
// A source scan cannot do this reliably. I tried: "gflow_video" appears nine
// times in this package legitimately (the tool list, the provider switch, the
// alias switch, the dependency switch, its schema, its description, the
// dispatcher), and a proximity window flagged the dependency switch and the
// schema map as chargeability sets. Text cannot tell a set from a coincidence.
//
// AND THE BEHAVIOURAL APPROACH DOES NOT CATCH IT EITHER. Verified: a mutant
// making describe answer from its own identical list passes this test. Two
// sources with the same values are observationally identical on every input,
// including unknown names — they diverge only once one of them is EDITED, and
// a test cannot observe an edit that has not happened.
//
// So "exactly one source" is a property of the SOURCE TEXT, not of behaviour,
// and it is not mechanically checkable by either route I tried. Recording that
// honestly rather than shipping a test that appears to guard it: a test whose
// passing means less than its name implies is the defect this whole phase kept
// finding.
//
// What this test DOES prove is narrower and still worth having: every
// published surface agrees with MayCharge for every tool, including names no
// enumeration contains, and the cost projection agrees with chargeability. A
// duplicate that has already DRIFTED is caught here. A duplicate that has not
// drifted yet is not, and no test in this package catches it.
