// Effects declares what running a tool can do outside Facet, for every
// request the tool accepts. Adapters such as the MCP server map it onto their
// own vocabulary. Facet only declares effects: it never asks for consent or
// enforces approval, which is the calling runtime's policy.

	// MayCharge: a run may bill the operator's account at a provider. The
	// amount is not knowable in advance, so it is never inferred from cost.
	MayCharge bool `json:"may_charge"`
	// Network: a run may contact a remote service or fetch remote content,
	// including content a rendered page references.
	Network bool `json:"network"`
	// ExternalWrite: a run may create, replace or delete files outside the
	// Facet process — outputs, evidence frames, downloads, staging files.
	// Exactly the complement of ReadOnly.
	ExternalWrite bool `json:"external_write"`
	// Deterministic: the same request against the same input files produces
	// byte-identical output. Claimed only where it was measured; a networked
	// or chargeable tool is never deterministic.
	Deterministic bool `json:"deterministic"`
	// ReadOnly: a run never creates, modifies or deletes any file and never
	// changes remote state; it only reads its inputs and reports facts. It is
	// a property of the tool, so it holds for every operation the tool
	// accepts: visual_qa's probe writes nothing but its review writes frames,
	// so visual_qa is not read-only. Reading inputs, probing them and
	// querying a remote catalogue do not break it; writing anything does.
	ReadOnly bool `json:"read_only"`
}

// EffectsFor returns the declared effects of a tool. It reads the same
// sources as `facet tools list` and `describe`, so the surfaces cannot
// disagree.
//
// A name that is not a Facet tool gets the most conservative declaration —
// may charge, networked, writing, not deterministic — so a caller that names
// a tool wrongly over-gates rather than under-gates.
